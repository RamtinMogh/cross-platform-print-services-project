# Problem Statement & Requirements (Multi-access Print Services)

## Background
BigGuy Corp relied on a stable Windows Server 2008 environment, but new systems introduced interoperability challenges. The organization required a printing solution that supports multiple companies and mixed operating systems while keeping testing simple using PDF “dummy printers.”

## Requirements
- Support printing between three environments:
  - BigGuy Corp
  - ABC Co.
  - Brasco Limited
- BigGuy and ABC Co. must both **send and receive** print jobs.
- Brasco workstations must **send print jobs only** (no receiving printers required).
- Use PDF printers for testing until the solution is stable and bugs are resolved.

## Documentation Expectations
The solution must be documented in a clear, step-by-step format suitable for readers with mixed technical backgrounds. Documentation should include:
- setup steps and configuration notes
- problems encountered and how they were resolved
- software used and any reference material
